        .. admonition:: On lack of endpoints

            This method handles database exclusive items, i.e., paths no longer on disk
            but still in the database. For typical Router designs, it is not important to
            preserve possible endpoints of origin for this kind of event; what matters is
            the absolute path of the file to be removed. In general, file events are
            associated solely with a path, but we in some cases may be sensitive to the
            base path seen to be "triggering" that file event, as router methods can hook
            in to specific endpoints. This has somewhat dubious effects, as multiple
            events (with the same action) are dispatched for the same file, purely to
            observe the Router convention of endpoints and allowing independent
            trajectories through the execution sequence.

            One concern here is that you might, in theory, want to respond to the same
            file deletion event in different ways under different endpoints. This will be
            accessible when picking up such an event live, as endpoints are grouped by
            watch descriptor and can be all be triggered from the single file event. This
            is the one case where we can't *really* simulate the event taking place with
            the available data, and instead have to peer into the router to see what root
            paths the file could theoretically trigger. Most of the time, this won't be
            too problematic, since we'll be watching the same paths and can tell where a
            deleted file would've been. But there are cases where a watch path endpoint
            may be abandoned, and thus no callback will be there to receive the DELETE
            event. *Routers should heavily consider implementing a global DELETE handler
            to prevent these cases if it's critical to respond to deletions.* Otherwise,
            we still make an attempt to propagate under appropriate endpoints, allowing
            for possible "deconstructor-like" behavior of specific filetypes (e.g.,
            cleaning up auxiliary elements, writing to a log, creating a backup, etc).
